### TestFlight

To join the TestFlight, you will need to join the [Aidoku Discord](https://discord.gg/kh2PYT8V8d).

### AltStore

We have an AltStore repo that contains the latest releases ipa. You can copy the [direct source URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aidoku/Aidoku/altstore/apps.json) and paste it into AltStore. Note that AltStore PAL is not supported.

### Manual Installation

The latest ipa file will always be available from the [releases page](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku/releases).

## Contributing
Aidoku is still in a beta phase, and there are a lot of planned features and fixes. If you're interested in contributing, I'd first recommend checking with me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kh2PYT8V8d) in the app development channel.

This repo (excluding translations) is licensed under [GPLv3](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku/blob/main/LICENSE), but contributors must also sign the project [CLA](https://gist.github.com/Skittyblock/893952ff23f0df0e5cd02abbaddc2be9). Essentially, this just gives me (Skittyblock) the ability to distribute Aidoku via TestFlight/the App Store, but others must obtain an exception from me in order to do the same. Otherwise, GPLv3 applies and this code can be used freely as long as the modified source code is made available.

### Translations
Interested in translating Aidoku? We use [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/aidoku/) to crowdsource translations, so anyone can create an account and contribute!

Translations are licensed separately from the app code, under [Apache 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html).
